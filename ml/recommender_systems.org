#+TITLE: Predicting movie ratings
#+STARTUP: latexpreview

* Formulation
  - $n_u$: number of users

  - $n_m$: number of movies

  - $r^{(i,j)} = 1$ if a user j has rated movie i

  - $y^{(i,j)}$ is the rating given by user j to i only if $r^{(i,j)}
    = 1$

* Content based Recommendations
  - Each movie can be represented by a feature vector containing
    features like x_0 = 1, romance, action, ...

  - We learn theta and predict the rating of user using a supervised
    learning algorithm as $(\theta^{(j)})^T(x^{(i)})$. The problem becomes

    $\min\limits_{\theta^{(j)}} \frac{1}{2m^{(j)}}
    \sum\limits_{i:r(i,j) = 1} \left ((\theta^{(j)})^T (x^{(i)}) - y^{(i,j)}
    \right )^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2m^{(j)}} \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n
    \left (\theta_k^{(j)} \right )^2$

  - Where $m^{(j)}$ is the number of movies rated by j. $\theta^{(j)} \in \boldsymbol{R}^{n + 1}$

  - We can remove $m^{(j)}$. Then sum over all j to consider all
    users and use *linear regression*.
