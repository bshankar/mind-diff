* Definitions
  - Morphism is a structure preserving map between two algebraic structures.
  - Functors are homomorphisms between categories

  - homo (same) -morphism is a morphism between the same types.

  - Functors preserve composition of functions (use this prove any F
    is a functor)

    $F(f \cdot g) = F(f) \cdot F(g)$

* Examples
  - map, filter
  - maybe functor

   # Needs further reading
** Function functor

* Type signature
  - /F: A -> B/
    (without affecting the composability)
