#+TITLE: Networking for web developers

* From ping to HTTP
** Setup
  - +Install vagrant, ubuntu/trusty64+
  - install openbsd-netcat, tcpdump, traceroute, mtr, dnsutils, lsof

** Try these commands
  
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ip addr show enp5s0
ip route show
ping -c3 8.8.8.8
host -t aaaa google.com
host -t mx udacity.com
printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.udacity.com \r\n\r\n' \ | nc www.udacity.com 80
tcpdump -n -c3 -i enp0s29u1u2 port 22
traceroute www.udacity.com
mtr udacity.com
#+END_SRC

** Ping
  - sends an echo request
  - goes to receiver's OS (no server)
  - receiver responds back

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80
#+END_SRC

** Netcat
  - printf converts \r\n into newlines but echo doesn't.
  - TCP is implemented in the OS. nc is a wrapper around TCP.
  - HTTP is implemented in the browser.
  - rst (reset packet) is an error when a message is sent to a port on
    which no server is listening.
  - nc -l can handle only a single connection (unlike web servers for Ex.)

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nc -l 3456             # listen to port 3456 in one terminal
nc localhost 3456      # connect and send some text (works both ways, using just TCP)
# disconnect with Ctrl D (Unix end of input signal), or Ctrl C
#+END_SRC

  - Be a web browser

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
printf 'HTTP/1.1 302 Moved\r\nLocation: https://www.eff.org/' | nc -l 2345
#+END_SRC

** IETF model

   | Layer       | Protocols      | Concepts                       |
   |-------------+----------------+--------------------------------|
   | Application | HTTP, SSH      | Urls, passwords                |
   | Transport   | TCP, UDP       | port numbers, sessions         |
   | Internet    | IP             | IP addresses, routes           |
   | Hardware    | WiFi, Ethernet | Signal strength, Access points |
   |             |                |                                |

** HTTP
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes][Status codes]]
   - epoll? in linux

** Ports
   - non-root user $2^{10}$ to $2^{16}$
   - root user starts from 1.
   - Address already in use error.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo lsof -i
#+END_SRC
