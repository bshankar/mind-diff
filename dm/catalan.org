* Expression

 $C_n = {2n\choose n} - {2n\choose n+1} = {1\over n+1}{2n\choose n} \quad\text{ for }n\ge 0$

* Recurrence relations

$C_0 = 1 \quad \mbox{and} \quad C_{n+1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}C_i\,C_{n-i}\quad\text{for }n\ge 0$

$C_0 = 1 \quad \mbox{and} \quad C_{n+1}=\frac{2(2n+1)}{n+2}C_n$

* $C_n$ is 
** Dyck words
  - A Dyck word is a string consisting of n X's and n Y's such that no
    initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's.
  - Number of Dyck words of length *2n*.

** Parenthesis
   - Number of ways to correctly match n pairs of parenthesis.
   - Number of ways to parenthesize n + 1 factors.

** Binary trees
   - Full binary trees with n + 1 leaves
   - Number of binary trees with n nodes.

** Lattice paths
   - Number of monotonic lattice paths on an NxN grid that don't go
     above the diagonal.

** Convex polygon
   - Number of ways to cut a CP with n + 2 sides.
   - Number of ways to pair vertices of a 2n-gon without intersections.

**  Permutations
   - Number of stack-sortable permutations of {1, ... , n} (Avoids
     permutation pattern 231)

** Stair step
   - Number of ways to tile a stairstep of height n with n rectangles.

** Mountains
   - Number of ways to draw mountains with up strokes, down strokes
     such that they never go below the horizon.
