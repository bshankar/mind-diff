* Guidelines
  - Training, Cross-validation/dev set, test set. (60/20/20% was the
     old standard)
  - In the 'Big Data' era, like m = 1,000,000 we can use 10k for each
     of dev and test sets.
  - dev, test sets should come from the same distribution.

  - Not having a test set might be okay.

* Bias / Variance
  - If optimal (Bayes) error is almost 0% for a problem (Cat vs Non
    Cat in humans)

  | Training set Error |            1% |       15% |                 0.5% |                0.5% |
  | Dev set Error      |           11% |       16% |                  30% |                  1% |
  |                    |               |           |                      |                     |
  | Diagnosis          | High variance | High Bias | High Bias & Variance | Low Bias & Variance |
